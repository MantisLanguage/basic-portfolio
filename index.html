            <article>I was electrocuted as a
                child and I believe it fried all my memories prior to grabbing that fence.
                One time, I was fined for refusing a kiss to a "lady boy" on Thailand national televison. I learned more
                being
                homeless in Greece for several months than I did through my entire bachelors and masters of science
                combined. My
                favorite food is shark, but I have also eaten kangaroo, scorpion, and crocodile amongst several other
                weird
                animals and/or organs. I have an italian <a
                    href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connor_Dougherty">wikipedia</a>
                page, although it hasn't been updated in a while.
                I'm finding that the hardest part to coding is CSS for me so far. Especially, when it comes to font
                positioning and wrapping, I have spent so much research trying to get this stupid copyright text to the
                bottom... and it just won't go. I figured this would beef up my about me, 'cause man I hate this
                copyright bar.
                Great, now it's happening on my header too. It's like this text just insists on peeping it's head over,
                but the laws of HTML and CSS are not letting it peek. It's almost as if my header and footer are
                auditioning for the neighbor of home improvement. Why can't they just calm down and lay at the bottom or
                even middle like a good font should? Feeling super jammed up right now. I think this is keeping me sane
                though.. or maybe the fact I'm typing this all out at all has proven I'm beyond the point of sanity.
                *Shrugs*, enjoy.
