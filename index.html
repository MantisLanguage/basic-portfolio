    <P>About Me</P>
    <article>
        <p>I was electrocuted as a child and I believe it fried all my memories prior to grabbing that fence. One time, I was fined for refusing a kiss to a "lady boy" on Thailand national televison. I learned more being homeless in Greece for several months than I did through my entire bachelors and masters of sciecne combined. My favorite food is shark, but I have also eaten kangaroo, scorpion, and crocodile amongst several other weird animals and/or organs. I have an italian wikipedia page, although it hasn't been updated in a while.</p>
