            <article>I was electrocuted as a child and I believe it fried all my memories prior to grabbing that fence.
        One time, I was fined for refusing a kiss to a "lady boy" on Thailand national televison. I learned more being
        homeless in Greece for several months than I did through my entire bachelors and masters of science combined. My
        favorite food is shark, but I have also eaten kangaroo, scorpion, and crocodile amongst several other weird
        animals and/or organs. I have an italian wikipedia page, although it hasn't been updated in a while.
